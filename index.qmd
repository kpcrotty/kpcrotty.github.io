My research interests include empirical asset pricing, information in financial markets, asset management, and investment performance evaluation. My papers are published or forthcoming in *Journal of Finance*, *Review of Financial Studies*,  *Journal of Financial Economics*, *Review of Asset Pricing Studies*, *Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis*, *Economics Letters*, and *Management Science*.  Prior to joining the faculty at Rice in 2012, I completed a Ph.D. in finance at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. I also hold undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of North Carolina.  

I currently teach Applied Finance to MBA students, Investments to undergraduate students, a quantitative investments lab course for MBAs and undergraduates, and a topics course for PhD students.  Kerry Back and I have developed an interactive website for teaching investments ([learn-investments.rice-business.org](https://learn-investments.rice-business.org)).
